            gameDiscount: originalDiscountPrice?.isDiscount,
            GamePrice: gamePrice,
            DiscountOriginalPrice: originalDiscountPrice?.DiscountOriginalPrice,
            FinalPrice: finalPrice,
            Keywords: []
        },
        About: {
            Description: description?.desc,
            Wikipedia: description?.wikiLink,
        },
        Extra: {
            Description: extraDescription,
            DLCS: [],
            Images: [],
            Videos: [],
        },
        Requirements: {
            Requirements: [],
            Minimum: [],
            Maximum: [],
        },
    };
```

**How to use**

1. Clone the project

2. Open a terminal inside and write the following command

```
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file and write down your MongoDB URI (Mongo Atlas)

```
URI={YOUR_MONGODB_URI}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Extra notes that you should read.

You will see:

```
const startPoint = 55;
const endPoint = 1020;
```

The **startPoint** is the starting steam page that you want to scrape from.

The **endPoint** is the last steam page that you want to scrape from.

You will see this function:

```
const autoScroll = async (page) => {
    await page.evaluate(async () => {
        await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            let totalHeight = 2000;
            const distance = 8500;
            const timer = setInterval(() => {
                const scrollHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
                window.scrollBy(0, distance);
                totalHeight += distance;

                if (totalHeight >= scrollHeight) {
                    clearInterval(timer);
                    resolve();
                }
            }, 100);
        });
    });
};
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Auto scroll does not work!

Unfortunately this feature won't work for some reason, so what you need to do is when the browser opens, you'll go to the steam pages first and grab the game urls, what you want to do is start scrolling very quickly to the bottom to load more content and more content.

In the **getGamesLinks** function you will see **await timeout(15000)**, you will have 15 seconds to scroll as fast as possible to load more content, if you want more time just increase the seconds.
